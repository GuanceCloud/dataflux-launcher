ingress:
  ## Set to true to enable ingress record generation
  enabled: ture

  ## Set this to true in order to add the corresponding annotations for cert-manager
  certManager: false

  ## When the ingress is enabled, a host pointing to this will be created
  hostname: launcher.test.com

  ## Ingress annotations done as key:value pairs
  ## For a full list of possible ingress annotations, please see
  ## ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md
  ##
  ## If tls is set to true, annotation ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true" will automatically be set
  ## If certManager is set to true, annotation kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true" will automatically be set
  annotations: {}
  #  kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx

  ## The list of additional hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## Most likely the hostname above will be enough, but in the event more hosts are needed, this is an array
  ## hosts:
  ## - name: wordpress.local
  ##   path: /

  ## The tls configuration for the ingress
  ## see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls
  ## tls:
  ## - hosts:
  ##     - wordpress.local
  ##   secretName: wordpress.local-tls

  secrets:
  ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ##
  ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  ## If you're using cert-manager, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  ##
  ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
  ## Please see README.md for more information
  # - name: wordpress.local-tls
  #   key:
  #   certificate:
